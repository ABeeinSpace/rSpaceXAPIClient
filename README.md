# Info

This is yet another client for the r/SpaceX API, located here: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API. It allows you to select an upcoming launch, the latest launch, an arbitrary launch using its launch ID from the API, and finally, a few notable launches as picked by me.

# System Requirements

1. A computer (This should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, but its only been tested on macOS)
2. Python 3 (I developed this program using Python 3.9, but any Python 3.6+ should work well enough)
